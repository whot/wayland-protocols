  <description summary="Wayland protocol for graphics tablets">
    This description provides a high-level overview of the interplay between
    the interfaces defined this protocol. For details, see the protocol
    specification.

    More than one tablet may exist, and device-specifics matter. Tablets are
    not represented by a single virtual device like wl_pointer. A client
    binds to the tablet manager object which is just a proxy object. From
    that, the client requests wp_tablet_manager.get_tablet_seat(wl_seat)
    and that returns the actual interface that has all the tablets. With
    this indirection, we can avoid merging wp_tablet into the actual wayland
    protocol, a long-term benefit.

    The wp_tablet_seat sends a "tablet added" for each tablet connected.
    That event is followed by descriptive events about the hardware;
    currently that includes events for name, vid/pid and
    internal/external/display type, and a wp_tablet.path event that
    describes a local path. This path can be used to uniquely identify a
    tablet, or get more information through libwacom.  Emulated or nested
    tablets can skip any of those, e.g. a virtual tablet may not have a
    vid/pid. The sequence of descriptive events is terminated by a
    wp_tablet.done event to signal that a client may now finalize any
    initialization for that tablet.

    Events from tablets require a tool in proximity. Tools are also managed
    by the tablet seat, a "tool added" is sent whenever a tool is new to
    the compositor. That event is followed by a number of descriptive events
    about the hardware; currently that includes capabilities, serial id,
    hardware serial and tool type. Similar to the tablet interface, a
    wp_tablet_tool.done event is sent to terminate that initial sequence.

    Any event from a tool happens on the wp_tablet_tool interface. When the
    tool gets into proximity of the tablet, a proximity_in event is sent on
    the wp_tablet_tool interface, listing the tablet and the surface. That
    event is followed by a motion event with the coordinates. After that,
    it's the usual motion, axis, button, etc. events.
    The protocol's serialisation means events are grouped by by
    wp_tablet_tool.frame events.

    Two special events (that don't exist in X) are down and up. They signal
    "tip touching the surface". For tablets without real proximity
    detection, the sequence is: proximity_in, motion, down, frame.

    When the tool leaves proximity, a proximity_out event is sent, followed
    by button release events for any button still down. This signals to
    the client that the buttons were held when the tool left proximity.
    Those events are all sent within the same frame.

    If the tool moves out of the surface but stays in proximity (i.e.
    between windows), compositor-specific grab policies apply. This usually
    means that the proximity-out is delayed until all buttons are released.

    Moving a tool physically from one tablet to the other has no real effect
    on the protocol, since we already have the tool object from the "tool
    added" event. All the information is already there and the proximity_in
    is all a client needs to reconstruct what happened.

    Any extra axis is normalized, i.e. the client knows the range as
    specified in the protocol (e.g. [0, 65535]), the granularity however is
    unknown. The current axes are pressure, tilt (both x/y required) and
    distance, the most common set.

    Since tablets work independently of the pointer controlled by the mouse,
    the focus handling is independent too and controlled by proximity.
    The wp_tablet_tool.set_cursor request sets a tool-specific cursor.
    This cursor surface may be the same as the mouse cursor, and it may be
    the same across tools but it is possible to be more fine-grained. For
    example, a client may set different cursors for the pen and eraser.

    Tools are generally independent of tablets and it is 
    compositor-specific policy when a tool can removed. Common approaches
    will likely include some form of removing a tool when all tablets the
    tool was used on is removed.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

    <description summary="a physical tablet tool">
      An unique object that represents a physical tool that has been, or is
      currently in use with a tablet in this seat. Each wp_tablet_tool
      object stays valid until the client destroys it; the compositor
      reuses the wp_tablet_tool object to indicate that the object's
      respective physical tool has come into proximity of a tablet again.
      A client must not call wp_tablet_tool.destroy until it receives a
      wp_tablet_tool.release event.

      A wp_tablet_tool object's uniqueness depends on the tablet's ability
      to report serial numbers. If the tablet doesn't support this
      capability, then the tool cannot be guaranteed to be unique.

      A tablet tool has a number of static characteristics, e.g. tool type,
      serial_id and capabilities. These capabilities are sent in an event
      sequence after the wp_tablet_seat.tool_added event before any actual
      events from this tool. This initial event sequence is terminated by a
      wp_tablet_tool.done event.

      Tablet tool events are grouped by wp_tablet_tool.frame events.
      Any events received before a wp_tablet_tool.frame event should be
      considered part of the same hardware state change.

	Sets the surface of the cursor used for this tool on the given
	tablet. The surface is only shown when this tool is in proximity of
	this tablet. If the surface is NULL, the pointer image is hidden
	completely.

	The parameters hotspot_x and hotspot_y define the position of the
	pointer surface relative to the pointer location. Its top-left corner
	is always at (x, y) - (hotspot_x, hotspot_y), where (x, y) are the
	coordinates of the pointer location, in surface local coordinates.

	On surface.attach requests to the pointer surface, hotspot_x and
	hotspot_y are decremented by the x and y parameters passed to the
	request. Attach must be confirmed by wl_surface.commit as usual.

	The hotspot can also be updated by passing the currently set pointer
	surface to this request with new values for hotspot_x and hotspot_y.

	The current and pending input regions of the wl_surface are cleared,
	and wl_surface.set_input_region is ignored until the wl_surface is no
	longer used as the cursor. When the use as a cursor ends, the current
	and pending input regions become undefined, and the wl_surface is
	unmapped.

	This request gives the surface the role of a cursor. The role
	assigned by this request is the same as assigned by
	wl_pointer.set_cursor meaning the same surface can be
	used both as a wl_pointer cursor and a wp_tablet cursor. If the
	surface already has another role, it raises a protocol error
	The surface may be used on multiple tablets and across multiple
	seats.
