  <description summary="Wayland protocol for direct fd access to input devices">
    This description provides a high-level overview of the interfaces
    in this protocol. For details, see the protocol specification.

    Some input devices do not interact with the windowing system. Examples
    of such input devices are gaming controllers or 3D mice. In many cases,
    a client requires direct access to the device to access or interpret
    device-specific functionality.

    This interface provides the ability for a compositor to pass a file
    descriptor to the client. The compositor may restrict the type of device
    designated as compatible device and it may restrict specific events from
    being sent to the client (e.g. by masking the Home button on a gamepad).
    Otherwise, a client should treat the device as if opened manually.

    This interface divides devices into type-based categories, clients are
    expected to only request access to devices that match the category they
    require. As of version 1, this interface provides only a single
    category: "gaming devices". Future categories of devices are expected to
    re-use the same wp_inputfd_device interface, but may differ in the way
    how to request them.

    Multiple input devices of the same type may exists and assigned to
    different seats. The top-level object of this protocol is a
    wp_inputfd_manager. Dependent on the device type sought after, a client
    may request a type-specific seat interface (e.g.
    wp_inputfd_manager.get_seat_gamedev). This seat then provides the list
    of devices for that category.

    Once a compositor deems a device to be focused on the client or on a
    client's surface it sends a wp_inputfd_device.focus_in event with a file
    descriptor for this device. A compositor may arbitrarily revoke access
    to the device by sending a wp_inputfd_gamedev.focus_out. Additionally, a
    compositor may invoke system functionality to restrict access to the
    file descriptor, e.g. by using EVIOCMUTE on an evdev fd.

    Otherwise, a client should treat the file descriptor as direct access to
    the device for the duration of it having access.

      <description summary="input fd device focus in event">
	Notification that this client now has the focus and/or access to
	this device. The decision what consitutes focus left to the
	compositor. For example, a compositor may tie joystick focus to the
	wl_pointer focus of this seat. The protocol does not guarantee that
	any specific client ever receives the focus for a device.

	The client is passed a file descriptor with access to this
	device. This file descriptor is valid until a subsequent
	wp_inputfd_device.focus_out event. Upon wp_inputfd_device.focus_out, the
	compositor may revoke the fd and further operations will fail.

	However, due to potential race conditions a client must be able to
	handle errors as if it opened the fd itself. No guarantee is
	given that the wp_inputfd_device.focus_out event or wp_inputfd_device.removed
	event are sent before the client encounters an error on the file
	descriptor.

	A compositor guarantees that the underlying device does not change
	until a wp_inputfd_device.removed event. In other words, if the fd
	type allows querying capabilities through the fd, a client needs to
	do so only once at the first focus_in. Subsequent focus_in events
	will provide the same capabilities.

	If applicable, this event contains the surface that has the focus.
	In some cases, the focus may not be tied to a specific client surface
	but is given to the client independent of any surface. In that case,
	the surface is null.

	The protocol guarantees that focus_in and focus_out always come in
	pairs. If the client currently has the focus and the device is
	removed, a focus_out event is sent to the client before the
	wp_inputfd_device.removed event.

	This event does not mean the device was removed, merely that the
	device is focused elsewhere. For device removal, see
